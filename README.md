📄**Description - Exercise Statement**

This exercise demonstrates the Singleton design pattern in Java.
The goal is to create a class `Undo` that replicates the functionality of an undo/history command. The class must store the latest commands entered by the user, allow adding and removing commands, and list all stored commands.
The class `Undo` is then used in a `Main` class, which allows the user to interact via console options to:

---
